## Introduction

Forecasting different phenomena have become increasingly popular with the advancement of technology and knowledge. Having an insight into not only the current happenings but projections of what is likely to happen, enables individuals to gauge the magnitude of the subject. Forecasting is also common in political and statistical analysis. Political events can take many different forms, including diplomatic choices, activities of political leaders, and other situations involving political institutions. Elections are a significant part of democracy and politics as it reflects the choice of the population. Election forecasting is a very popular form of statistical analysis used by political scientists. Mathematics, statistics, and data science are frequently used in political forecasting methodologies. Forecasting elections has a variety of uses including academic and public reasons (Lewis-Beck, 2005). Election projections appeal to a primal human desire to peek into the future (Norpoth & Stegmaier, 2017). Humans have always been drawn to the idea of predicting election results with some degree of precision, since elections were created to choose leaders. It informs leaders and followers about a likely outcome, enabling them to make any required adjustments. It might also indicate a change in the policy goals of political activists. Additionally, any interested party can evaluate a campaign by keeping track of the election forecasts. Effective election forecasting models satisfy intellectual curiosity of the population. As citizens, the majority of us are interested in knowing who will win and by how much. In a functioning democracy, this knowledge is inherently fascinating. Since, election is the process through which leaders are chosen, it is an extremely significant matter for the population. This is because numerous financial, social and economical factors such as unemployment benefits, tax rates, interest rates, human rights, subsidies and more are dependent on the party elected and its leaders. 
In the 2019 federal election, the Liberal party, led by Justin Trudeau, won the election to form a coalition government. With the second-highest number of seats in the parliament, the Conservatives became the official opposition. The 2019 election was ranked the second for the lowest vote share for a party to create a single-party minority administration. This shows the popularity of the party and its leadership qualities declined over the years. Thus, our research will focus on whether the Liberal Party will win the next election in 2025 or whether other parties will take over. 

###Terminology

This statistical analysis report includes numerous political and statistical terminologies. Some examples of statistical terminologies include population, sample, mean, distribution, weight, regression, parameter, confidence interval, variance, survey, target population, non-response biased sample and histogram. 
Population: is a group of elements about which we wish to make an inference (Jo-Caetano, 2022).  \n
Sample: is a condensed, controllable representation of a larger group. It is a subgroup of people with traits from a wider population. When population sizes are too big for the test to include all potential participants or observations, samples are utilized in statistical testing. \n
Response variable: is a variable that researchers are trying to predict or explain. \n
Explanatory variable: is one that explains or predicts the change in the response variables and thus, it can be anything that affects the response variable. \n
Target population: population that the intervention is intended to study and take conclusions from. \n
Hypothesis: proposition tested using observations and statistical experiments. \n
Some political terms include candidate, federal and elector.  \n
Candidate: is an individual running for public office and vying for a seat in the House of Representatives (Elections Canada). \n
Elector: is a Canadian citizen who is at least 18 years old and thus qualified to vote (Elections Canada). \n
Federal: a system of government or nation where authority is split between a central administration and many regional governments (provincial governments). \n
These terminologies are used numerous times throughout the report to analyze the data set and answer the research question accordingly.  \n
Democracy: A form of government in which the citizens of a country have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation or government officials. \n
Maximum likelihood estimate: It is a likelihood function that calculates the conditional probability of observing the data sample, given a probability distribution and distribution parameters.

###Data & Hypothesis

In this analysis, we use two distinct sets of data. We consider the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset as the ‘census’ data and the Canadian Election Study 2019 dataset as the ‘survey’ data. For the 2019 CES, there are 2 data files: an online survey and a phone survey. In this analysis, we are using the phone survey to build a model to predict which party the population is leaning towards. This paper attempts to find the most influential factors to predict which party is most likely to win the 2025 Canadian federal Election. In addition, it also attempts to identify the demographics of individuals who are most likely to vote for the top two electoral parties, the Liberal party and the Conservative party.

In the next section we introduce the dataset we used to perform the analysis to predict the election outcome and provide a numerical summary of the important variables, before we delineate in the third section, the statistical methods we used to build and assess a relevant forecasting model and explain the parameters of interest. The fourth section then outlines the results derived using the methodologies with interpretations of the figures and tables. The sixth section concludes the analysis with a brief recap of the hypotheses and comments on drawbacks regarding the model.


## Data

The General Social Survey was established in 1985 and every survey includes a key problem, exploratory questions, and a standard set of socio-demographic questions used for classification (Statistics Canada). The main aim of the GSS is to collect information on social patterns  for the purpose of addressing specific social policy concerns. Datasets from GSS and scholarly articles issued by Statistics Canada are available to all concerned parties which they can use to study numerous phenomena (Statistics Canada). A complete statistical portrayal of Canada and its citizens based on their demographic, social, and economic aspects is provided by census data. The output of gathering responses from study participants is survey data. It serves as the foundation for making educated decisions in various circumstances and is a fair depiction of the viewpoints and perceptions of the target audience.	
The GSS was established in 1985 and every GSS survey includes a core topic, focus or exploratory questions, and a standard set of socio-demographic questions used for classification (Statistics Canada). The primary objective of the General Social Survey is to collect data on social trends for the purpose of addressing certain social policy challenges. All interested parties have access to GSS datasets and analytical articles issued by Statistics Canada and can use them to study numerous phenomena (Statistics Canada).

The main goals of the Canadian Election Study are to give a comprehensive account of the election, to highlight the key factors that influence people's voting decisions, to show what changes and remains constant throughout the campaign and from one election to the next, and to draw attention to the similarities and differences between voting and elections in Canada and other democracies. The second goal is to advance scientific understanding of voter motives and the significance of elections and election campaigns in democratic nations. The third mandate of this election study is to gather information about Canadians' attitudes and beliefs regarding a wide range of social, economic, and political issues. This information was then made available to researchers in the fields of political science, sociology, economics, communications, and journalism (Stephenson et al, 2020). In order to learn more about Canadians' attitudes and beliefs before, during, and after the 2019 federal election, the 2019 Canadian Election Study was carried out. It carries on the tradition of Canadian Election Studies, which was established in 1965. 

The outcome information gathered from a sample of survey respondents is known as survey data. This information is thorough data that was acquired from a target audience regarding a particular subject to perform research. The methods for gathering survey data and doing statistical analysis are numerous. Since 2013, GSS data have been gathered by combining telephone interviews and self-completed online questionnaires (Statistics Canada). In order to lessen the burden on respondents and increase data accuracy, some data, most frequently income statistics, are derived from tax or other administrative files as opposed to being directly collected through surveys. On the other hand, the online sample for the 2019 Canadian Election Study was composed of a two-wave panel with a modified rolling-cross section during the campaign period and a post-election recontact wave (Stephenson et al, 2020). The data collection process of the CES data we are analyzing in this paper is also telephonic. Traditional element sampling methods, like stratified random sampling and systematic selection, are used for telephone sampling for list frames. The data from these two surveys were then analyzed in Rstudio, a programming language for statistical analysis and graphics.

Before the cleaning process, the GSS data set contained 20602 observations and the CES 2019 data set contained 4021 observations of 278 variables. However, some rows had observations set to N/A because they lacked sufficient information. To keep the flow of the observations consistent, the rows of observations that were set to N/A were removed from the data sets. Additionally, we compared the GSS and the CES data sets and cleaned them to only include the questions that overlap to help make this analysis feasible using statistical tools. We found that most of the overlapping questions were demographic based questions, and these important variables are described in the Data section of the paper. After cleaning the data sets and selecting the common variables, the GSS (census) data set contained 17034 observations of 8 variables and the CES 2019 (survey dataset) contained 1027 observations of 9 variables. Additionally, the variables in both the data sets were adjusted to be in sync and of the same datatype where each numeric was referred to the same identifier for both data sets.

### Description of Important Variables

The response variable in our analysis is ‘party to vote for’ which represents the party the individuals in the sample would most likely vote for. The question for this variable was structured as “Which party do you think you will vote for?” This variable will help directly answer the research question as to which party is likely to get the most votes. The common predictor variables in both the datasets are age, province they currently live in, marital status, education attainment, whether or not they have any religious affiliations, the language they speak, and their household income which are explained in detail in Table 1. 
Age: It refers to the period of human life measured by years since birth characterized by certain mental and physical developments with legal responsibilities. 
Province: The country of Canada is divided into regions termed as provinces for administrative purposes. 
Marital status: It refers to the distinct options that show a person’s relationship with his/her significant other.
Education: It refers to the highest level of education or achievement of the learning objectives of a certain level that an individual has achieved successfully through validated assessment of acquired knowledge, skills and competencies. 
Religious affiliations: It refers to the religious and spiritual beliefs and practices a person adheres by.
Language: It is the main medium of human communication that consists of words and is expressed through speech, writing, and gesture.
Household income:  It is the combined gross cash income of all members of a household who are above 15 years of age. It is used to evaluate the economic conditions and compare living conditions between geographic regions that is often dependent on government policies
Sex:  It refers to the two main categories of human which are male and female, based on their reproductive functions

## Methods

Regression is a predictive modeling technique that is used to find the relation between a response variable and one or more predictor variables. When two or more predictor variables are used to predict the response variable, it is termed as multivariable regression. Regression analysis can be broadly classified  into two categories: (1) linear regression and (2) logistic regression. Linear regression is used to establish a linear relation between the response and dependent variables. On the other hand, logistics regression is used to calculate or predict the probability of  a binary outcome from a set of predictor variables. Binary outcome refers to a scenario where only two outcomes are possible: the event happens or the event does not happen. For the purpose of analysis using statistical software, the possible outcome of the event occurring is assigned a value of 1 and the event not occurring is assigned a value of 0 (Thanda, 2022). For our analysis, since our response variable is trying to predict which/whether a specific political party will either win or lose the federal elections of 2025, we will be dealing with binary response data and therefore, logistic regression will fit our purpose the best.

In reality, it might not always be possible to collect a sample that is a true representative of the target population that we are interested in measuring. In such situations, a large sample is collected with many different types of demographic data on the individuals in the sample. This will enable us to partition the data into different demographic cells and estimate the response variable for each cell. We will then extrapolate the cell-level estimates of the response variables to population-level by weighing each cell by its relative population proportion. In doing so, post-stratification gives more accurate or precise inference on the population-level data based on a poorly representative or non-response biased sample. In our analysis, we will be estimating the response variable of each cell using multi-variable logistic regression and then use the GSS data since it is a good representative of demographic data of the entire population to extrapolate the cell-level estimates as per relative population proportion of that specific cell. (Jo-Caetano, 2022).


Our sample data needs to satisfy the assumptions of a multi-variable logistic model which are as follows:
independence of errors: As logistic regression often serves as a classifier, the response variable in the dataset must match the kind of logistic regression being utilized (binary, multinomial, or ordinal). Logistic regression by default posits a binary outcome variable with a two-outcome maximum.
linearity in logit for continuous variables: The relation between each continuous independent variable and the logit (also known as log-odds) of the outcome must be linear in order for logistic regression to work using the box-tidwell test.
Absence of multicollinearity: When there are many highly associated independent variables in the data, this is referred to as multicollinearity. This is a concern since it lessens the accuracy of the calculated coefficients, which diminishes the logistic regression model's statistical potency. A set of independent variables' multicollinearity is gauged by the variance inflation factor (VIF). VIF can have a minimum value of 1 only which would indicate absence of collinearity whereas a VIF number greater than 5 denotes multicollinearity that exists and can affect the accuracy of our data.
Lack of strong influential and outlier observations: Since outliers and influential observations might affect model's accuracy, logistic regression makes the assumption that there are no extreme outlier and highly influential data points. An outlier is a point that is different from other observations while influential data points affect the skewness of your model.  We determine if our dataset  has outliers or influential observations using statistical methods Cook’s distance and DFFITS. 


### Model Specifics
There are numerous statistical tools that can be used to select the best predictors to use in our logistic regression model. In our analysis, we first built a model using all the 7 overlapping variables between the GSS and the CES dataset. We then reduced the model by comparing the significant p-values based on t-test to select predictors that best explains variations in the response variable and are most influential in explaining the logistic regression relationship. We chose 5 predictors with the smallest p-values which are sex, language, province, marital status and education. In other words, these 5 predictors are the most significant variables to explain the logistic relationship. 
Using the 5 selected predictors, we built a reduced logistic model and to validate this regression model, we used a few statistical tools. 
Firstly, it is necessary to check if our model satisfies the assumptions of a multivariable logistic model. Non-collinearity between the independent variables is an assumption that is measured using variance inflation factors (VIF). When there are many highly associated independent variables in the data, this is referred to as multicollinearity. This is a concern since it lessens the accuracy of the calculated coefficients, which diminishes the logistic regression model's statistical potency. A set of independent variables' multicollinearity is gauged by the variance inflation factor (VIF). VIF can have a minimum value of 1 only which would indicate absence of collinearity whereas a VIF number greater than 5 denotes multicollinearity that exists and can affect the accuracy of our data.
To further compare and establish that our reduced model is indeed a better model to predict the response to our research question, we used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and McFadden’s Pseudo R^2 value. BIC is a statistical tool for assessing how well a model fits the dataset. It helps us in choosing the predictor variables that best describe the changes in the response variable. The smaller the value of BIC, the better is our model in representing the changes in the response variable (Shelton, 2019). Another goodness of fit for logistic regression models is McFadden Adjusted R^2. McFadden’s Pseudo R^2 ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 indicates a good model fit (Wikipedia Foundation, 2022). Furthermore, AIC is another different measure that explains how well a model fits that data. The calculation of AIC uses the number of parameters and maximum likelihood estimate. There is no particular threshold for AIC values. So, the model with the lowest AIC score is the better one as it has the least number of parameters explaining the response variables the most.(Bevans, 2020)

## Post-Stratification 

For the post-stratification process, we used the GSS (census) data and only include the variables from our reduced model, Sex, Province, Education, Marital Status and Language. For every combination of demographics based on the mentioned variables, we calculate the proportion of each category. We found 278 unique bins for these variables and selected the top 2 bins that are most likely to vote for each party, the Liberals and the Conservatives. The table showing these bins are included in the results section. 
Table: by abrar

Now, to predict the Yps values which is our parameter of interest, we use the probability of each bin to vote for the Liberal Party in contrast to the Conservatives. Using this estimate and the proportion of each bin we found earlier, we calculate the respective Yps (probability) values by finding the product of the estimate and the proportion.

The results of the methodologies included in the report.
• An explanation/interpretation of the results and the poststratification estimate
TABLE x: BIC, MCFADDEN, VIF
TABLE X2: Post strat table

Table x shows that the BIC value for the reduced model decreased compared to the full model. The VIF values for all predictor combinations in the reduced model is less than 5. 
McFadden's pseudo r^2 value also decreased. 
All these measures represent that the reduced logistic regression model we finalized is a better representation of the relationship between the response and predictor variables. 


Table X2 shows that a married, French-speaking, female identifying individual from Quebec with education level below bachelor’s degree has the highest probability to vote for the Liberal Party with a y_ps value of 0.8279641100%.

In contrast, the category of an individual with the highest probability of voting for the Conservative party with a y_ps value of 0.0000799043% is a widowed, English-speaking, male identifying individual from Quebec with education level below bachelor’s.
